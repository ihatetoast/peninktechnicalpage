## Technical Documentation for Letter Writing

This is one of freeCodeCamp's required challenges for their Responsive Web Design certification and must pass 16 tests, so it follows their specifications. The content, however, is up to me. I did not want to be tempted to leave it with filler text or rely on what others have done for JavaScript or other tech topics, so I chose letter writing. This also allowed me to practice writing about something I take for granted.

The look of this is influenced by the type of website (technical document) and its topic (letter writing). I wanted to keep the architecture simple while giving it a paper and pen feel.

I choose to publish and deploy as I go:
