      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>Letter writing, simply put, is the exchange messages. They may be personal or professional; heartfelt or
        distant;
        handwritten, typed, or printed. Printed letters are distinguished computer-mediated communication (CMC),
        commonly
        referred to as email, e-mail, electronic mail, and texting.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="assumed_knowledge">
      <header>Assumed knowledge</header>
      <p>Letter writing involves using words to communicate and it is assumed that know the following:</p>
      <ul class="main-section-list">
        <li>
          <h2>Spelling: conventional, regional, phonetic</h2>
          <p>It is not necessary to use UK English spelling if you are American or Hochdeutsch if you are Austrian.
            Also,
            phonetic spelling suffices, as letter writing does not exclude those with varying degrees of background and
            education.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Basic Grammar</h2>
          <p>It is not necessary that you know all the rules of your language's grammar; however, you must be
            comfortable
            in basic grammar if you wish to communicate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Other people</h2>
          <p>Letter writing is the exchange of messages between you and at least one other person. If you find that you
            do
            not know other people, please consider journalling or diaries, or you may wish to get out more. There is no
            need
            to know many people or to be an extrovert. Go on. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="materials">
      <header>Materials</header>
      <p>There are a variety of materials required for letter writing. You do not need all, but some materials work
        better
        with others and many require specific pairings. It is best to focus on your preferred method for applying words
        to
        paper.
      </p>
      <p>If you prefer a writing utensil:</p>
      <ul class="main-section-list">
        <li>
          <h2>Pen</h2>
          <p>A basic pen (or even a pencil) is enough for a letter. Some pens have inks that smear, and some pencil
            leads
            are soft. If you are concerned about making mistakes, a pencil is a good choice, or have ready a correcting
            fluid
            or ribbon.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Paper</h2>
          <p>Paper ranges from lined with holes punched for storage in binders to bond typing paper to professional
            calligraphy
            papers. The choice is up to you; however, the purpose of the paper is to allow the words to be seen. Paper
            should
            be a color that constrasts with the color of the ink and should be porous enough to hold the ink. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Special instruments: nibs &amp; inks</h2>
          <p>Fountain and dip pens, quills, and inks are mostly used for occasions when calligraphy is required: formal
            announcements,
            invitations to special events, diplomas and certificates. Nibs are the part of the pen where the ends can
            split
            depending on the pressure. This splitting allows for the writer to vary the thickness. Thicker strokes have
            more
            ink, and depending on the type of paper, may require blotting papers so the ink does not bleed. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you prefer machine:</p>
      <ul class="main-section-list">
        <li>
          <h2>Word processor</h2>
          <p>Word processors are the contemporary version of a typewriter. It consists of an attached keyboard, small
            screen
            to view your text at your current location, and built-in word-processing software that allows you to save,
            edit,
            and print what you have written. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Computer</h2>
          <p>For our use, the term "computer" refers to a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smart phone. Like the word
            processor,
            most computers will come with some form of word-processing software already installed. You may prefer to
            stick
            with Microsoft's Office software or Apple's Pages; however, there are other software packages available for
            you
            to install on your own. All word-processing software will be able to write, delete (similar to erase, but
            without
            leaving a trace of the error), and save what you have written.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Printer &amp; paper</h2>
          <p>Printers allow you to tranfer what you have written on your machines to paper. Most printers have trays
            that
            hold paper of certain dimensions. They also have moving parts that were built with certain materials in
            mind
            and jam easily. Because of this, printers work best with standard printing paper. You should consult the
            manual
            for your printer.</p>
          <p>Word processors sometimes can be hand fed and may take a wider variety of paper types and weights. Some
            have feeders. As with a printer, consult the manual.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="your_first_note">
      <header>Your first note</header>
      <p>The shortest form of a letter is the note. It is customary to include a greeting or salutation, body, an
        optional
        closing line, and a signature. The most common greeting is &#8220;Dear&#8221;, followed by &#8220;Hello&#8221;.
        Common
        closing lines are &#8220;Sincerely&#8221;</p>
      <p>White space in letter writing does not affect meaning; however, it is used to assist in readability. It is
        customary
        to start the salutation or greeing and closing line at the same margin, and the body and signature indented 2-5
        spaces.
        Word processors often have a built-in index function, so notes have uniform margins and indentation. With
        handwritten
        notes, there can be slight variations.</p>
      <p>Examples of notes using pen and paper or a word processor and printer:</p>
      <pre>
        <code class="pen-ink">
          Dear Dolly, 

              Hello!

           Love, 
            Horace
          
        </code>
      </pre>
      <pre><code class="typed">
        Hello, world, 

          How&apos;s Dennis?

        Brian
      </code></pre>
      <p>Note that when using &#8220;Hello&#8221; followed by a name, one uses a comma between &#8220;Hello&#8221; and
        the
        name because the name is the vocative case. The letter writer is saying hello to the addressee.
        &#8220;Dear&#8221;,
        on the other hand, is an adjective that describes the addressee. </p>
      <p>Notes are often written on smaller pieces of paper or pages torn from a notebook. Some write notes to oneself
        on
        the backs of their hands; however, this form of note writing is not advised for notes that contain private
        messages,
        passwords, or other sensitive information.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="letters">
      <header>Letters</header>
      <p>Letters are similar to notes. The main differences are the size of the body and the method of delivery: the
        bodyusually has a full paragraph, often several, and the letter is enclosed in an envelope and delivered by the
        postal service.
      </p>

      <ul class="main-section-list">
        <li>
          <h2>The informal (personal) letter</h2>
          <p>Informal or personal letters are written to family members and friends. The main purpose of a personal
            letter
            is strengthening the connection between the sender and addressee.</p>
          <ul class="main-section-list">
            <li>
              <h2>Sender’s address</h2>
              <p>This is usually the sender's home: street address; city; state, province, or territory; and zip or
                postcode.
                If the sender is not sending the letter from home, the address should be where the sender currently is
                writing
                from. In this case, general location (city, state, province, or territory) will suffice. The location
                of the address is at the top right of the letter. The address should be left justified but as far to
                the right as possible without lines being cut off or moved to the next line.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Date</h2>
              <p>The date the letter is written may be in any format; however, be mindful that different countries have
                different date formats. To avoid confusion, writing the month out in full or its standard abbreviation.
                The date may fall a few lines under the sender's address or a few lines below but flush to the left
                margin.</p>
              <p>Is this June 7th or July 6th? Note how using the word for the month helps.</p>

            <li>
              <h2>Salutation and name</h2>
              <p>Depending on the sender's relationship to the recipient, salutations and greetings may range from
                &#8220;Dear &lt; name &gt;&#8221; to a term of endearment such as &#8220;Darling&#8221; or &#8220;My
                dear&#8221;. The salutation is flush against the left margin.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Introductory paragraph</h2>
              <p>The introductory paragraph sets the mood or establishes the reason behind the letter. It may refer to
                a previous letter or ask how the recipient is doing. It has been traditional to indent the first line
                of a paragraph 5 spaces; however, it is acceptable to not indent. If the writer chooses to skip
                indenting, then there should be extra spaces between paragraphs for legibility.</p>

            <li>
              <h2>Main content paragraphs</h2>
              <p>The largest part of the letter is the main content. It contains what the writer wants to communicate.
                It can contain day-to-day activities, gossip, and news, or it could, like a jounral, convey the
                sender's concerns, feelings, or emotions. The reason the person is writing should be in the main
                content. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Closing paragraph</h2>
              <p>The closing paragraph is short; its purpose is to end the letter so that there is not an abrupt end
                after the main content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Complementary closing and signature</h2>
              <p>Closings should have the same sense as the salutation, i.e. affectionate closings go with affectionate
                salutations. Closings are followed by a comma, and the signature is on the line or below. In typed
                correspondences, the name of the sender maybe typed several lines below, leaving space for the
                signature or initials of the sender. Closings for hand-written notes start in the middle of the page,
                but typed letters have the closing and signature on against the left margin.</p>
