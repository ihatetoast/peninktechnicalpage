      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>Letter writing, simply put, is the exchange messages. They may be personal or professional; heartfelt or distant;
        handwritten, typed, or printed. Printed letters are distinguished computer-mediated communication (CMC), commonly
        referred to as email, e-mail, electronic mail, and texting.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="assumed_knowledge">
      <header>Assumed knowledge</header>
      <p>Letter writing involves using words to communicate and it is assumed that know the following:</p>
      <ul class="main-section-list">
        <li>
          <h2>Spelling: conventional, regional, phonetic</h2>
          <p>It is not necessary to use UK English spelling if you are American or Hochdeutsch if you are Austrian. Also,
            phonetic spelling suffices, as letter writing does not exclude those with varying degrees of background and education.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Basic Grammar</h2>
          <p>It is not necessary that you know all the rules of your language's grammar; however, you must be comfortable
            in basic grammar if you wish to communicate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Other people</h2>
          <p>Letter writing is the exchange of messages between you and at least one other person. If you find that you do
            not know other people, please consider journalling or diaries, or you may wish to get out more. There is no need
            to know many people or to be an extrovert. Go on. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="materials">
      <header>Materials</header>
      <p>There are a variety of materials required for letter writing. You do not need all, but some materials work better
        with others and many require specific pairings. It is best to focus on your preferred method for applying words to
        paper.
      </p>
      <p>If you prefer a writing utensil:</p>
      <ul class="main-section-list">
        <li>
          <h2>Pen</h2>
          <p>A basic pen (or even a pencil) is enough for a letter. Some pens have inks that smear, and some pencil leads
            are soft. If you are concerned about making mistakes, a pencil is a good choice, or have ready a correcting fluid
            or ribbon.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Paper</h2>
          <p>Paper ranges from lined with holes punched for storage in binders to bond typing paper to professional calligraphy
            papers. The choice is up to you; however, the purpose of the paper is to allow the words to be seen. Paper should
            be a color that constrasts with the color of the ink and should be porous enough to hold the ink. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Special instruments: nibs &amp; inks</h2>
          <p>Fountain and dip pens, quills, and inks are mostly used for occasions when calligraphy is required: formal announcements,
            invitations to special events, diplomas and certificates. Nibs are the part of the pen where the ends can split
            depending on the pressure. This splitting allows for the writer to vary the thickness. Thicker strokes have more
            ink, and depending on the type of paper, may require blotting papers so the ink does not bleed. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you prefer machine:</p>
      <ul class="main-section-list">
        <li>
          <h2>Word processor</h2>
          <p>Word processors are the contemporary version of a typewriter. It consists of an attached keyboard, small screen
            to view your text at your current location, and built-in word-processing software that allows you to save, edit,
            and print what you have written. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Computer</h2>
          <p>For our use, the term "computer" refers to a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smart phone. Like the word processor,
            most computers will come with some form of word-processing software already installed. You may prefer to stick
            with Microsoft's Office software or Apple's Pages; however, there are other software packages available for you
            to install on your own. All word-processing software will be able to write, delete (similar to erase, but without
            leaving a trace of the error), and save what you have written.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Printer &amp; paper</h2>
          <p>Printers allow you to tranfer what you have written on your machines to paper. Most printers have trays that
            hold paper of certain dimensions. They also have moving parts that were built with certain materials in mind
            and jam easily. Because of this, printers work best with standard printing paper. You should consult the manual
            for your printer.</p>
          <p>Word processors sometimes can be hand fed and may take a wider variety of paper types and weights. Some have
            feeders. As with a printer, consult the manual.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
